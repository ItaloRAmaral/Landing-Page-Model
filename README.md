##### I made this landing page after 2 months of studying the fundamentals of web development at Trybe.

##### This page was made in HTML, CSS, and a little JS to give dynamism to the page, nothing else was used. The landing page model was made using _[Luiz Otavio Miranda's](https://beacons.page/otaviomiranda)_ course as a reference.

##### Fell free to use or improve this project with more functions or style!!

##### Lets Grow Together!!!
